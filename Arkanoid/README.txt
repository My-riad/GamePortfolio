Arkanoid is a pong like game that's been around for a long time. I've added power ups to the game such that hitting the red block speeds you up and adds a score 
multiplyer, and a yellow block multiplies your score by the amount of blocks you've hit in a row. 

The "OxideGameplayTest.exe" file inside of the "Builds" folder will start the game.
